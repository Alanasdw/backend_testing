// this is for redis make test
sudo apt-get install tcl

https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/4028

need to write a script to start up redis then start celery
// maybe docker-compose?

start the daemonized redis-server with the command below( in the /redis-stable)
redis-server --daemonize yes

// need to think to have compiling and running workers

// for differnet tasks
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19670534/assign-different-tasks-to-different-celery-workers

// seems important in the comments
https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/reference/celery.bin.multi.html


// the worker part seems to just be celery?
// maybe daemonize the celery workers and have the producer be up when called?

// 1 compiler worker and 30 running workers per machine?
// the compiled program will sit in the same glusterfs as other test case inputs?



// for the worker machines
// python3 is required for celery
pip install -U celery[redis]
